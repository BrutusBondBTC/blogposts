  
I began writing a blog about using bitcoin as censorship resistance money a couple years ago because most people don't talk about anything other than the price of 100,000,000 sats. They say things like:

- "Wen Lambo" 
- "To the moon!"
- Forever Laura!

It's all fiat-maxi language disguised as bitcoin maxi rhetoric. I would be lying if I said I didn't care about the price at all, but I became interested in bitcoin for ideological reasons. It's nice that I can buy more groceries today than I could a couple years ago, but that's not what turns my crank. I may have heard about bitcoin from Antonopolis, but Ayn Rand orange pilled me before that.

I want to be financially free from banks. I'm not all the way there yet. I have a mortgage I pay in fiat. I have a few hundred bucks in a savings account and about eight bucks worth of change in my office. I also carry a couple hundred dollars worth of green paper in my soft wallet. It's getting harder to use that green paper these days because more and more businesses would rather pay a sales tax to the bank than accept cash.

I don't talk about the fiat price much. I don't trade "crypto," but fell in love with cryptography. I prefer nostr to Twitter. **I earn sats, save sats, and spend sats** and started using bitcoin as peer 2 peer electronic cash about a decade ago. 

My blog is nostr. You can follow me on there. This is not financial advice, it's not even a blockchain. Nostr is a decentralized communication protocol that uses public-private key pairs. You know... cryptography. 
## My New Podcast

I decided to turn this blog into a podcast. The idea is to read my blog posts out-loud, using AI because I sound like a mumbling dweeb.

This podcast has no paid ads, but I plan to showcase businesses who participate in what I call the elliptic curve economy, also known as the circular economy. **These are not paid ads**. My goal is to bring  plebs business through word of mouth advertising because I believe this is the best form of advertising.   I consider these value 4 value ads. Hopefully my podcast will bring these pleb businesses some extra revenue, but this is no act of altruism. In my opinion, the more people who use bitcoin as a medium of exchange, the faster we can remove bitcoin off the exchanges. If you buy something from a bitcoin business, another pleb stacks more bitcoin. The more bitcoin that gets stacked, the more valuable my store of value becomes. It is a mutually beneficial relationship.

## Value 4 Value


I am using the value 4 value model. After my blog, I will answer call-in questions  about bitcoin to the best of my ability. Ask a question by sending a boostagram on your favorite podcasting 2.0 player.

I'll do my best to answer the question on the next show. 

Here's the pod. I'm, still working on the kinks like audio quality, editing, et cetera, but I find this technology much more fascinating than how much fiat you can obtain with 100 million sats.
