*This was my first blog post on Ghost. Before this I wrote under this nym on wordsmith. 
 have decided to re-post all my blogs on nostr.  to be honest, many of them suck, but I want to post them here anyway To remind myself how much I have learned and how much I still need to work on my craft.*

*At first, I used the image of a real person on pixelfed. I regret this decision. I also later changed my nym to Blogging Bitcoin. I still use BrutusBondBTC on Github because they won't give me permission to use BloggingBitoin.*

# My Nym Is Brutus Bond


My nym is Brutus Bond. You won't find this name on my driver's licence . I started writing a blog about bitcoin because I've been obsessed with it since 2014.  I want a way to explore my ideas about bitcoin and teach people how to use it. I'm using a pseudonym for the following reasons:


- Anonymous writing has a long tradition in the US. I chose Brutus becuase it was the nym chosen by the person who wrote my favorite Anti-Federalist Paper
- Satoshi was a nym and showed that it was possible to have a completely peer-to-peer cash system that allows world-wide commerce without an identity attached.
- I was inspired by Rockstar Developer's appearance on Citadel Dispatch. 

My goal is to become a soverign individual by building a small audience willing to **pay me 250 sats per week** or 13000 sats per year.  I will also donate 10% of everything I make to [opensats.org](http://opensats.org). I realize making a living off donations worth 10 cents is a longshot, but it's something I want to try. I believe the Internet is better if we can avoid the surviellence capatalism that preys upon us all, making us spend more money than we should on things we don't really need.

The idea is to write about bitcoin everyday and ask for donations. I'm trying something I like to call a reverse paywall to do this.  Normallly, a writer provides a small sample of thier article before asking you to pay 50-500 per year to read the rest.

## **250 Sats Per Week**

I decided to present my article first and then ask for a small donation at the end of the article. The paywall comes at the end instead of the begining. You are only asked to pay 250 sats at the end of the article. If you can't afford it, you still get to read the article.

 I hope you enjoy it.  I started writing this blog on wordsmith. It's like a rough draft, but I'll leave it [here](http://https://wordsmith.social/brutusbond/) in case you want to read more of my writing.
