# How To Accept Bitcoin At My Business

​

"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the

baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own

interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their

self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their

advantages."

Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations written in 1776.

​

There are a couple breweries about an hour away from me that accept  bitcoin.  One brewer uses Aqua Wallet. I like Aqua Wallet and did a video tutorial about it [here](# "here"). This is a fairly easy system. This works well, except for two problems.&#x20;

1\) Fees on small transactions like soft drinks, are expensive.

2\)  We thought the owner had to be there. Now that I think of it, we can re-use liquid addresses. I haven't thought of this before because Satoshi Nakamoto said:

​

\["As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each&#x20;
transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some&#x20;
linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which&#x20;
necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The&#x20;
risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal&#x20;
other transactions that belonged to the same owner."]\([https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/addresses/](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/addresses/ "https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/addresses/"))

​

This does not apply to Liquid BTC transactions however. The brewer can tape a QR code of a Liquid Address to a bar like this. WE can scan it to get the pay the following liquid address.

​

&#x20;We can see there are two outputs. We can see the transaction fees cost 26 L-btc sats, but we do not know how much the transactions were. This is electronic cash.&#x20;

A butcher buys a beer from a brewer in transaction number one. A baker  buys a beer from the brewer in the second transaction. The butcher knows how much he paid the brewer. The baker knows how much he paid the brewer. The brewer knows both how much the butcher and brewer paid him, but the banker does not know anything about these transactions between the butcher, the baker and the brewer. The butcher does not know how much the baker spent. Nor does the baker know how much the butcher spent. He might not even know the other transaction was made by a butcher. Maybe they are sworn enemies. The butcher is on the Carnivore diet. He thinks the carbs are evil. The baker thinks people on the carnivore diet will drop dead of a heart attack. These guys don't know any of that stuff to buy a beer. They live in an open society and can get along. They don't need to show their support for diet and lifestyle every time they buy a beer.&#x20;

​

In this situation a brewer with an Aqua Wallet Wallet just needs to print a QR code of a single Liquid address on their Liquid wallet. Like the banker, the bartender will also not be able to see the amounts paid on the liquid blockchain with the address alone. To show proof of payment, we must wait a couple minutes for the payment to confirm. blocks on the Liquid blockchain confirm in a minute, but we need two conformations before we can verify the amount paid. In our example the butcher and the brewer need to click "View unblinded transaction in explorer.&#x20;

​

That's pretty good, but it only shows the L-Bitcoin sats. The person will also need to show the cashier how much those sats were worth in dollar terms. I guess she can also write it down manually for the brewers account, but that's a proverbial pain in the ass. Luckily, anyone with Internet access can use a point of sale terminal instead -Even people who are great at brewing beer bit don't know much about computer networking.

**Coinos**

​

Coinos is a simple bitcoin point of sale system.&#x20;

1\)Push the Start in Seconds button.

2\)Create A Username and password. You can do this randomly or a few words from the [EFF wordlist](https://www.eff.org/dice "EFF wordlist"). A passphrase like this will take several hundred years to crack, but we will use this wallet like a cash register. You empty a cash register out after the bar closes. Perhaps you send the bitcoin to your Aqua Wallet from home sweet home at the end of the night. The bartender working the bar will see the transactions, but will not be able to spend them. You can essentially be your own Brinks from the comfort of your own couch. If you wear a tin foil hat as a fashion statement, you could sweep the Coinos wallet to a self custody every five minutes, but nobody realistically want's do to that.

​

Now our brewer has a coinos wallet. We can add this website to our old phone or a table. We can also have a QR code that allows a customer to use their phone as a POS terminal. In our example, we will use this website as our point-of-sale terminal.

[https://coinos.io/TheBrewer/receive](https://coinos.io/TheBrewer/receive "https://coinos.io/TheBrewer/receive")

As long as we are  not logged in, we will only see the payments and the bartender will not be allowed to spend the bitcoin or liquid payments.

​

Let's change some stuff in the settings.

​

It is totally customizable. You can add your logo and add your email in case you forget your passphrase.

You can integrate shopify

​

Toggle your nostr identity and you now have a nostr account too. I won't get into nostr in this article, but it is a powerful protocol and this makes it easy to get a nostr profile. You can obtain your secret nostr key(A.K.A. nsec) from the settings menu. Save it in a notebook or password manager like vault warden. I am showing you what it looks like in this example, but you should keep your nec a secret.

​

The Bartedner can take the payment or the customer can pay from their phone.   In this example, the baker pays the bartedner \$8.00 <img src="http://umbrel.local:8920/lib/af4ab066-ee0a-44cf-a623-3fa46d4a22ec/file/images/auto-upload/image-1723070579181.png?raw=1" alt="undefined" title="undefined" width="567" height="341" />

​

The customer can choose to pay in bitcoin, liquid bitcoin, or bitcoin on the lightning network. On this example,we will use the lihgnting network. We choose Lightning and click show QR code.

​

​

​

The bartender can see it is paid.

​

​

​

At the end of the night. the brewer sends the sats to his wallet of choice. We will use aqua wallet in this example again, but it could be green or a jade hardware wallet. There are many options. The Brewer can send the money to his own wallet by clicking the home button. He must be signed in. The bartender will not be able to do this, Only the person with the passphrase can spend from the coinos terminal. We can scan it, but in this example I will paste the LNURL. I also made the transaction for 13000 sats to cover any fees we might incur.

​

Now we need our wallet back to our Aqua Wallet. This is a custodial solution, but it is very easy and you can withdraw at anytime. This is the easiest way to accept bitcoin at your business. We can also see all the transactions by clicking the clock icon. You can use this to do your taxes or export the file as a spreadsheet and give it to your accountant. The received section is income. In this example, the brewer needs to pay taxes on\$8.00 worth of income.&#x20;

Coinos makes it very easy for our business to accept bitcoin, but it is a custodial solution. You do not want to keep your life savings on it. This is why I suggest using it like a cash register. Sweep it to a more secure wallet at the end of each night. Liquid is good because it helps you stack sats with smaller fees. If you still feel like you need help, [BTCsessions has a great video](https://www.btcsessions.ca/post/coinos-bitcoin-wallet "BTCsessions has a great video") that explains al of this stuff on YouTube. Odell also has a great podcast with the people behind Coinos on this episode of [Citadel Dispatch](https://serve.podhome.fm/episodepage/CitadelDispatch/cd114-circular-economies-with-coinos "Citadel Dispatch")
