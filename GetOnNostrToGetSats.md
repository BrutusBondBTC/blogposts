# Get On Nostr To Get Sats

![nostr](https://i.nostr.build/dwE03.png)

This is not another orange pill. There are no more orange pill books  to be written. Like Satoshi said, "If you don't believe me or don't get  it, I'm sorry, bur I don't have time to convince you."

This is not about reading charts or looking for dildos that would  make a great pattern for an ugly Christmas sweater. I offer no price  predictions because in 150 years, your great, great, great, great,  great, great grandchildren will read about the fractional reserve fiat  ponzi scheme in history books written by large language models.  Meanwhile, fiat is an endangered species. I understand **most people come to bitcoin for the fiat gains**. I suspect my blog would be more popular if I wrote things like bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 in 48-72 hours according to my scribbles transcribed over a price chart. Sorry, I can't tell you what the fiat price of bitcoin will be within 72 hours or 72 years. I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know how to measure the scarcest asset in the world against this:

This is a guide  designed to teach you how to use bitcoin as peer to peer electronic cash and store your wealth for seven generations. I would like to turn it into a book and sell more books than the woman who wrote Harry Potter, but I also think it is important to keep this information free for anyone who cannot afford it. The amount of money printing is making me more and more concerned about fiscal stability of the global financial system. This is not financial advice. It is a life jacket. Think of it as a seat cushion in an airplane. I hope you never need this flotation device, but I want it available, just in case. I hope our great senile leaders can fix this, but I wouldn't hold my breath, so I want to teach people how to use bitcoin before it's too late. But first, let's pop the purple pill..=

In the first chapter, I showed  you the secret message Satoshi left in the genesis block, "Chancellor  on the brink of second bailout for banks." In the second chapter, I  wrote about why the Cypherpunks wanted private, electronic cash in the  first place. The purpose of this chapter is to teach you how to use a custodial bitcoin wallet on a corner of the Internet where people use bitcoin for electronic payments. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that does not require a corporation or government. Nostr is The Internet without any corporations or government required to operate. If you sell stuff on Amazon, you must pay fees to Amazon. Therefore, Amazon is your master. If you sell stuff on a nostr powered marketplace like [Shopstr](https://shopstr.store/), you have no master. 

Covid taught us the collective tend towards authoritarianism during times of crisis(perceived or otherwise). The [Twitter Files](https://twitterfiles.substack.com/p/1-thread-the-twitter-files) taught us there is a partnership with legacy social media and agents of the United States Government. If a legacy social media company in the United States is not controlled by a U.S. corporation, expect them to [ban it](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/technology/bytedance-tiktok-ban-bill.html) unless it can be sold to an US corporation. If the government trending towards a "closed society" [cuts off your bank account](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy) for protesting forced vaccinations, these communication networks become important. Nostr makes sending payments to bitcioners as easy as Venmo without any government imposed red tape.

## The Social Bitcoin Payment Layer

![payments](https://i.nostr.build/8GMag.png)

Nostr has become the de-facto, social bitcoin payment layer. Most  people still think of it as a boring alternative to addictive social  media like Twitter, but it is much more than this. This guide is  published on habla.news a website that allows anyone with an npub to  publish long-form content. People can send me sats for this content and I  can send sats to content creators and developers.

Nostr has a marketplace similar to what you might find on Zuck's face  tracking book. It has YouTube like video and twitter spaces like audio.  To use these tools, you will first need to create a public/private key  pair. Your public key, npub, can be shared with anyone. Your private  key, nsec, must remain a secret. If your nsec is compromised, your  identity is compromised and we can no longer trust your notes are from  you. That would suck, but it's good practice for storing bitcoin keys.  If your identity gets compromised, you could spin up a new one. If you  lose the keys to your life savings, it won't be so easy to get it back.

Keep in mind that this is a custodial wallet so **not your keys not your bitcoin** applies.  This is a beginner wallet that allows anyone on the nostr network to  send you sats, but you don't want to use this for your life savings. The  wallet also has cutting edge features like [data vending machines](https://www.data-vending-machines.org/intro/?ref=blog.mutinywallet.com) that  allow you to pay for AI generated images and chats. You can even use AI  to turn text to voice, but we will not cover these advanced features in this guide.
