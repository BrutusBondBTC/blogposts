I started a YouTube Channel about a year ago, but the Google Gods won't let me publish videos without a phone number. There are ways around it, but I decided it was too much of a pain in the ass to deal with. I also had a hard time justifying using YouTube, which is owned by Google when I use the Whoogle search engine. It doesn't align with my values.

I ran a PeerTube instance for a while, but that was a different kind of pain in the ass, so I created a Rumble Channel. They have some fiat monetization scheme, but I want to go balls to the wall and accept zaps only because I don't want to be beholden to any advertisers. Here is my first Rumble Video.
