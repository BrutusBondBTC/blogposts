**Thank you** for being here. This electronic book is written using the [Value 4 Value model](https://blog.getalby.com/the-case-for-value-4-value/). Since information longs to be free, I have put it out here for everyone to see. If you value my work, please send me time, talent or treasure. 

I  do not want to have ad revenue influence my writing, so I have no sponsors.  Sponsors are a security hole. For example, some of the most lucrative bitcoin wallet affiliate deals, are not wallets I would recommend to my friends and family. Many bitcoin Influencers ran ads for  BlockFi, a bitcoin lending platform that went up in smoke after SBF blew up CrYpTo. BlockFi was the quintessential example as to why we always say, "not your keys, not your bitcoin," yet many people with high follower accounts fell for it hook line and sinker. Most normies are not aware that we have reached an all time high since then.  Now the mere word bitcoin causes most of them 0groan](https://www.businessinsider.com/osu-commencement-speaker-ayahuasca-praises-bitcoin-booed-viral-2024-5?op=1).

**I am not mad at these influencers**. They shill these things because they are incentivized to shill them. I  want my writing free from this influence. I don't want to risk my reputation by promoting rug-pull technology, but most of all, I would rather you pay me directly in bitcoin than to pay fiat to some other corporation that will pay me fiat that I will sell for bitcoin. Selling the words I write this way cuts out the middle man. This is not investment advice., This is about me trying to use bitcoin as money in a fiat world. 



Your support helps me do this.
