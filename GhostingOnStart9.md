# Ghosting on Start9

I started his blog in March of 2022 using Bitlaunch, but I no longer want to pay for the Virtual Private Server. It makes much more sense to host it on Ghost over Tor Using my Rasberry Pi than it does to host it over a Virtual Private Server.

I tried running this on Yunohost at first. It worked, and it also gave me access to things like peer tube and a few other interesting programs, but I switched to Start9 because was worried about exposing my IP address.

Now I'm running Start 9 and transporting my Ghost site from BitLaunch was easier than I expected.

I was going to post everything to Nostr. but there is a tool being built that will make it much easier. Until then, I'll just host it over TOR.
