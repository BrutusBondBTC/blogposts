Blogging Bitcoin is an independent, **censorship-resistant** publication launched in March 2021 by [Blogging Bitcoin](https://iris.to/bloggingbitcoin). 

I write a [blog](nostr:npub1wkljx5c6a8uccc5etws8ry0y3r4dgavh2dcav0tal4rtmcdl4z2sfu5u0t) about using bitcoin but I also find applied cryptography(things like nostr and PGP) fascinating.



This blog is published on [nostr](https://nostr.how/en/what-is-nostr)

It's a little different. There are no ads or paywalls. **I don't even have a website**. I write using the [Value 4 Value Model](https://value4value.info/about/) because corporate surveillance sucks and I want my opinions free from the influence of advertising. **Therefore my work is entirely supported by my audience**.  **All time, talent and zaps are appreciated.**


You can also **support my blog** by shopping at my [Plebeian Market stall ](https://plebeian.market/stall/bloggingbitcoin) on the nostr **circular economy**.
 
### Fresh content, no emails.
**Email Subscriptions suck too.** They are an abuse of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. I still need a way to avoid writing in a void. **Join my [Telegram](https://value4value.info/about/) to get updated about my new blog posts or [Rumble](https://rumble.com/c/c-5024088) videos**.
