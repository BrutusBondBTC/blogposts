I bought belt from LeatherMint and liked it so much, I decided to write a testimonial. This is a value 4 value testimonial, not a paid ad. I‚Äôve always been suspicious about ads. I know rhetorical tools like ethos are a super-duper effective form of persuasion, but I‚Äôve always found it suspicious. I understand Michael Jordan was the GOAT basketball player. If Jordan has advice for becoming a better basketball player, you should listen to him, but his ability to pick underwear might not be a slam dunk.

Even if someone paid me to tell you camel hair underwear is the most comfortable underwear on the planet, I wouldn't want to write a testimonial about it. I am shilling LeatherMint‚Äôs belts because they are low time preference accessories.

I needed a good belt. I'm a bitcoiner and we're cheapskate's. We don't like to spend our precious sats. I keep my underwear until it has more holes than the moon. That's why I need a good belt. I know privacy is not a popular right these days, but I don't want my pants to fall because I don't expose my holy underwear to the world. Privacy is a human right. I use my belt to protect my privacy.

The belt is custom made to fit my waist. If you're not sure about your belt size, his guide explains how to find it easy-peasy style. He even makes half-sizes. Maybe you learn this if you shop at Nordstrom's or something, but I never knew how to choose a belt size. Most belts I buy have a range of sizes like 34-36, but not my belt from LeatherMint. It's made just for me.

The buffalo leather is smooth and sturdy. Many belts I've owned flap around and stretch out. Not this one. The brass hardware looks better than the crap metal and stitches on my old belt. For the record, I may know a lot about bitcoin, but my fashion sense is abysmal. I've always bought belts that were too long and didn't fit right. Maybe that's why my other belts flapped around like that. Regardless, this belt was 4 times more expensive than my old belt, but it was worth every sat. I think it will last longer than a store bought belt. Besides, the Bitcoin And Podcast discount was was also too sexy to resist.

I bought my last belt from J.C. Penny's for $25.00 on Black Friday. It can best be described as black, flimsy, and cheap. According to the words stamped on the leather: "hecho in India." It's branded with the Levi's jeans logo. Levi's was my favorite brand of jeans in the 80's. Founded in San Fransisco in the midst of the gold rush. They sold low-time preference clothes at a time when people panned for low time preference money. Levi's were made in America and rugged. I used to care about that, but almost nothing but arrests are made in the US these days. Back in the day, they had commercials that said, "buy American and American's work." Fast food is just abput the only thing the US still makes.

This belt was made in Canada, but as far as I'm concerned, it was made by a ‚Çøitcoiner. **Buy from a ‚Çøitcoiner and ‚Çøitcoiners work.** LeatherMint put his proof of work into this belt and it shows.

Most clothes, like fiat money, are not built to last anymore. It's difficult to build a long lasting wardrobe in a world of fast fashion, but bitcoin fixes this. It makes you think twice about spending money on clothes you'll need to replace in less than a year and it seems like LeatherMint makes belts that are built to last.

## Proof of Respect
proof of respect

The belt shipped to my PO box in a black box with a proof of respect card with a QR code on the back. I assumed it was a reciept, but I was wrong. It's a bitcoin address. People send bitcoin to this address as a tip. 

According to LeatherMint, "There's a respect vibe to leather. And respect goes both side. I feel it from my clients and I try to show them too.

And yeah respect is important to me. Before money I think my real goal is gaining respect from the Bitcoin community. Money will flow from there."

I never thought much about this before, but it makes sense. It's simmilar to the importance of reputation the cypherpunks emphasized decades ago. Belts should be respected because it cost the life of a buffalo.  Great care and craftsmanship went into making this belt. I can see how respect is required in leatherwork. LeatherMint puts his proof of work into his craft. You won't be sorry for buying one of his belts.


Clothes made under the fiat standard are not built to last anymore. It's difficult to build a long lasting wardrobe in a world of fast fashion, but bitcoin fixes this. It makes you think twice about spending money on clothes you'll need to replace before they see 52,000 blocks and LeatherMint makes [low time preference](https://mises.org/podcasts/audio-mises-wire/low-time-preference-leads-civilization) belts that are built to last.
