I like the ideas of artists getting paid on Nostr and recently came across this post from BTC Minstrel. I've never met him, but I saw Allen Farrington sing his songs at the Pacific Bitcoin Conference. It was one of my favorite parts of the conference.

Anyway, Minstrel asked this on Nostr

I told him he could use nostr.build since it aligns with the nostr ethos, but then thought about that value 4 value model again.

Wait a minute. I was really into bittorrent way before bitcoin was even a thing. I can just do it for him.

So I tried, but the file was too big.
There Are A Couple Options

If you want to go the self-sovereign route, you can use PeerTube or host videos on pixelfed. These are kinda like Mastadon for YouTube and Instagram. It's also kinda technical. To set these up, I had to use a dedicated URL on yunohost and set up my own email server. To be honest, it's kind of a pain in the ass.
Here's What I Did

The videos are already on YouTube though, so it's not like we an't use those videos.

I also came accross this new blogging site that uses Markdown so I put the video on the riverside.rocks instance of invidious, added a screenshot to nostr.build, and wrote a little markdown.  It looks like this. Click on the image and it will start playing .

1BTC=1BTC

You wouldn't need to put it in a blog. It should show up on clients that use markdown like snort.social,

Here's what it looks like in markdown:

[![1BTC=1BTC](https://nostr.build/i/nostr.build_dfdd780a7406ab17069feb8c9df9997bd78b9ef22fbb6474c191f35bbe1770bc.png)](https://inv.riverside.rocks/watch?v=47aMaoXISZI)  
Paste that in your feed.

You can use this as a template .

To add "What Would Shall We Do With Michael Saylor", just replace the title, upload a new screenshot to nostr.build, and add change the video.

I like to use inv.riverside.rocks because it blocks the ads. I should run my own, but I already run too much software.

Anyway, I hope that helps.  Nip04 me if you have any questions.

Find Value in this Blog post?  Zap me.

Don't have any sats to spare?  Share this on nostr and those social media, walled gardens.

Got any ideas to make this tutorial better, please contribute.  I bet this would be better with a gif instead of static photo but I don't know how to make gifs. I would be happy to learn.
