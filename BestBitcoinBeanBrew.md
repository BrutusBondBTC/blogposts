# Stay Humble, Brew Your Own Coffee

**Note: The Satoshi Coffee Company, Amazon, WalMart and coffee cups are not affiliate links**.

## Equipment
You'll need an [AeroPress](https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press/dp/B07YVL8SF3/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=aeropress&qid=1702486875&sr=8-6)

I use [sats.coffee](https://sats.coffee/) to support the bitcoin circular economy.

Coffee Cup.  I can't vouch for anyone on this list, but [check out the mug market on nostr](https://letsnostr.com/t/mug).

Cold water because hot water tastes like water heater.

### Interested In Getting Sats Back?
**Note: These are referral links** 

#### Oshi App

I swear, I was going to share this company anyway because I found out about the Oshi sats back reward on sats.coffee after I bought my first order. I could have saved myself thousands of sats. I also met Michael Atwood at a meetup in Newport Beach a couple years ago. He's a ride or die freak and told me about this new business he created, basically Groupon for Bitcoiners. We had a great conversation and I really like that dude, but totally forgot about Oshi app. So I plan on using it more. I also started this blog to teach people how to use bitcoin and promote the bitcoin circular economy. The [Oshi App](https://oshi.team/bloggingbitcoin) aligns with this mission.

**Save 10% off two bags of coffee from Satoshi Coffee Co.** When you use the [Oshi App](https://oshi.team/bloggingbitcoin)

Even if you don't like coffee, sign up for the [Oshi App anyway](https://oshi.team/bloggingbitcoin). You're bound to find something you do like and support the bitcoin circular economy, save sats, and send me a little percentage of sales. I also want you to create your own referral link too and share it with other people. I'm not saying you'll earn enough to quit your job, but maybe you'll get more people interested in using and saving sats. This is not financial advice, but that's got to be better for the value of bitcoin than dorks doodling dumb-ass charts.
