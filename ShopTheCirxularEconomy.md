# Shop The Bitcoin Circular Economy

In an effort to help build the circular economy, I want to increase awareness of businesses that accept bitcoin as payment.  **These are not Paid Ads**.  I list these companies because I use their services and find them valuable.  I hope they find value in my word of mouth advertizing. Please spend some sats with them to support the circular economy

The following is a list of business that I use:

[Coinkite](https://coinkite.com/)

You have heard of them for sure, the maker of the world famous Cold Card. If you don't have a cold card, you need to get your shit in order, but the company makes at least 50 products.  I don't have a discount code for this company, but listen to a bitcoin podcast and I'm sure you will find one. Coin kite does a lot of other cool shit too, like the satschip, a product designed for artists.  NFT's are a scam, but physical art is a real thing. Artists who add the satschip to their physical artworks can throw a photo of the artwork on the CoinKite website.  These jpegs are not NFT's. They are not Ordinals. They are art with a chip that works similar to the Tap Signer, except the seed can never be revealed. It ties the physical paining, a , et al. to the bitcoin blockchain. It's neat way of tying art to digital scarcity without all the scammy bullshit associated with NFT's

[Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/us/en/) let's Me buy gift cards with bitcoin. I used to use it to pay my bills, but they have since discontinued that service. I still think it's a great company and use it as a way to get discounts on certain stores like CryptoCloaks.

[CryptoCloaks](https://www.cryptocloaks.com/) is a company that sells  3D printed items for sats. I hae bought quite a few things off them. Most recently, a case that my S9 which has been converted into a heater. He has a lot of other cool stuff too. Check him out.

[BitcoinHatGuy](https://bitcoinhatguy.com/) has sold hats for bitcoin for decades and I have spent more sats on these hats than I feel comfortable admitting, but have never regretted my purchases. In real life, I'm one of those wierdos that wears the same thing everyday: Black T-Shirt and Gray pants, but I have an extensive hat collection. I buy most of my hats with bitcoin and most of those hats were bought from BTChatGuy. They're great, cheaper than MLB or even minor league baseball hats and I don't watch sports anyway. If you wear hats, buy a hat from this dude.

[Robosats](https://learn.robosats.com/)

Bitcoin exchanges are some of the biggest spenders in the bitcoin content creation market. They are the bread and butter for content creators.  This makes sense, because they also get the most in fees. According to David Bennet from the Bitcoin and Podcast, The Cash App had over a billion bucks in revenue from bitcoin sales alone. Good. I'm happy for the Block, but smaller bitcoin only exchanges like RoboSats don't get the exposure they deserve because they don't have the marketing budget.  RoboSats is a peer to peer exchange.  It's only on TOR, but they also have an app on the Andoroid store for those too timid for TOR.

Robosats is a bitcoin escrow service. They hold bitcoin in escrow and wait for conformation that payment has been recieved. Bitcoin sellers generally sell for about 5% above market value to provide KYC Free Sats to customers. Fiat settlements are made using the Cash App, Strike, or even Amazon gift cards. We should market the p2p exchanges like this more. Robosats  incentives this by giving users or referal codes. Refer someone to RoboSats using your referral code and you will get 100 sats for each trade. I would like to see people shill RoboSats and pick up these sats on social media. So I am not only asking you to use RoboSats, but I am also asking you to shill it.  I had nodeless.io on the list, but the tyrannical government of Canada shut it down. When I attempt to orange pill normies, the objection I most often need to overcome is "Bitcoin can never work because the government[state] will shut it down. The 100k bitcoiners in the world know it does not work that way, but most CPI believers think the government just needs to shut down the single bitcoin computer to take it all away.  Perception is reality as they say. And yeah, we won't all turn off our bitcoin mining heaters or shut off our nodes, but I have seen online Poker get decimated by government policies. They did not succeed at ending online poker, but they essentially ended access to online poker for anyone with a sub 120 IQ.  If we want bitcoin to be for everybody, we need to make it easy for people to buy non-KYC bitcoin. RoboSats is making that their mission.

[Nostr.build](https://nostr.build)

Nostr Native video and image storage. you can login with your npun instead of an email or using nip07. The premium membership also includes access to btcpayserver, but you'll need to set it up. The subscription lasts one year, but the developers told me they won't actually delete your photos for two years.  I love nostr.build and think it is an underrated resource in the nostr community



[BTCPins](https://btcpins.com/)

BTCPins sells cool bitcoin collectible PINS. They're reasonably priced and look great. He only accepts bitcoin because he is a true ride or die freak. He is also one of the meetup organizers in Southern California and wears hats sold by Bitcoin author, Knut Svanholm. He's the real deal.

[Strike](https://strike.me/)

Strike would pay me like five or ten bucks if I had you sign up with them via my referral link, but I'm not recommending them for the referral money. This is about recommending services I use. Strike is the best way to send fiat around the world. I also know that many bitcoiners don't like the idea of spending their own bitcoin, Strike gives you the ability to instantaneously convert fiat to bitcoin and vice-versa. I would rather have the hodl never sodl people spend fiat in the circular economy this way.

In a perfect world, Strike would not comply with KYC laws, but like I said, it's the best way to send fiat around the world.(or people on Robosats who could be anywhere in the world.) I also think if a KYC free exchange is to expensive, you're better off stacking a little on a KYC exchange than not stacking at all. Budgets are tight these days. If you can only stack a penny this paycheck, stack that penny with Strike.  Need to send fiat to Mexico, use Strike instead of Western Union.

[Seed Signer](https://seedsigner.com/)

Seed Signer is a raspberry pi with no Wi-Fi. You can make your own or buy one from the store. The seed signer does not have a secure element, but it also does not store your seed on the device. Therefore, you must write down your seed and enter it into the device every time you plug it in. This sounds like a pain in the ass, and it is if you do it that way, but it comes with a camera and a unique neat feature. You can create a QR code using a pen and paper.(You'll need access to a printer too) Actually, I recommend using a pencil and paper. It's easy to make a mistake so you might want to erase it. You can always go over it with a felt tip pen later if you're worried about a man in the middle attack. You can also use it for nostr keys I think, but I have not tried this feature. I would not  trust all my bitcoin with any wallet, but this is an excellent wallet to use as part of a multisig with Sparrow Wallet or Specter Desktop.

[Get Alby](https://getalby.com)

Get Alby is my favorite desktop wallet. I've made spme videos about them here and highly recomend it because you can use it as a custodial wallet or hook it up to your own node. I also respect this product a lot. Back in 2017 or 2018 we had the Joule browser extension, but you had basically had to be a lightning engineer to get it to work. I wasted many hours of my life away trying to get it to work on my browser with no dice. Alby is about 100X improvement over the old Joule days. They also have some cool nostr features and make it easy to login to websites.  Full disclosure, I have no idea how they make money.

[Plebai](https://home.plebai.com/https://home.plebai.com/)

You put a dollar into a vending machine and it spits out bubbly sugar water. This data vending machine works like that. You put im 100 sats and it will genorate an AI image or create a summary for your blog. It's an awesome service and does not require a subscription like some of the fiat competition.

LeatherMint
I bought a belt from leathermint and it was one of the best purchases I ever made online. I highly recommend buying things from this site https://theleathermint.com/. I wrote about my experience [here](https://habla.news/u/bloggingbitcoin@nostrplebs.com/bad-ass-belts-from-leathermint).

These are not all the products I use, and I will add more over time. **If you have a bitcoin side hustle or sell a bitcoin related product, let me know about it**. I'm always interested in learning about more bitcoin companies.
