Might as well face it, you will not orange pill Peter Schiff. You will not orange pill anyone on X(Twitter). They pay $11.00 worth of fiat to earn more fiat. They also give $11.00 worth of fiat value to people who have more than X amount of followers. Everyone else pays or gets shadow banned. It's cheap ransomware, not a serious attempt at free speech.

There's a better way to promote the use of bitcoin without playing stupid fiat games. It's time to offer the purple pill.

- The Purple Pill does not require a blue check.
- The Purple Pill allows anyone on the network to send bitcoin to anyone in the world.
- The Purple Pill is pretty perfect.

Well...It's not perfect, but it makes it easy for anyone to accept bitcoin payments.

### Purple Pill Github

[Karnage](nostr:npub1r0rs5q2gk0e3dk3nlc7gnu378ec6cnlenqp8a3cjhyzu6f8k5sgs4sq9ac) said he wished he could zap handbrake, free and open software used to rip DVD's. I use it to add my movies to [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). I've been thinking about asking non bitcoin projects like this to get on nostr so I can zap them because I don't want to sign up with buy me a cup of coffee.

So I added¬†[https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues/5915](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues/5915).  
Karnage said he already did the same to another project. What if we all asked a free and open source project to get on nostr for zaps? Each zap could be distributed to many developers. Developers are technical. Getting on nostr should't be a problem for them.

#### Purple Pill Servers

Purple pill your servers. 250,000 blocks ago, I thought it would be cool to sell buttons with lightning payment QR codes. I envisioned flare for waitresses. Back in the day, waitresses at TGIF's wore buttons to advertise chile cheese fries and happy hours. I thought they should wear buttons that allowed customers to send them sats. I used a QR code from my tip me page, but it didn't work because the QR code could only be used once. What can I say? I didn't know what the hell I was doing back then.


Nostr fixes this. My idea couldn't work in 2019 an buttons are still a dumb-dumb idea, but we can still pay wait staff with no buttons required.

If a waitress had an npub, I could just search for her nym attached to an npub. She could use this npub for tips only. She would never need to read comments, but she could collect zaps. Some wallets, like Mutiny let you find nostr plebs in the wallet. You can send them sats. You'll soon be able to send ecash.

##### Purple Pill The People


![barber](https://i.nostr.build/6GVOn.png)


Stop saying, "Buy Bitcoin." Say, "earn bitcoin". Don't sell bitcoin. I don't mean this as in, "hodl never sodl." I mean give a little bitcoin to people. You don't use Paypal. You don't use Venmo. You might use the Cash App, but don't ask for someone's Cash Tag.  Give people the purple pill. Onboard them onto nostr. Send them zaps.

- Purple Pill your barber
- Purple Pill your barista
- Purple Pill your bud tender.
- Purple Pill the people.


Bitcoin crushed the all time high again, but nobody seems to care. They are [watching the dollar crash](https://chapwoodindex.com/) . Interest rates are up. This doubled the price of a mortgage as compared to a few years ago. Interest rates went up to lower price of things which naturally deflate to the marginal cost of production.* **Fiat currency is dying**. People are not excited about the bitcoin price because $70,000 just isn't what it used to be. If you have your barbers npub, you can send him better, unbroken money. He can see the value of that money go up over time. Your tips become a DCA strategy for this hair-cutting scissor samourai.

No need to be pushy. Just teach him how to use nostr. Add him to your contacts. Have him add his profile to Mutiny Wallet. Send him cashu. Send him sats. Teach him there's a better way to save. **Give him the purple pill.**
