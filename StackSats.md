### Stay Humble,  Stack Sats

"Stay humble, stack sats" is a term used by Matt Odell that summarizes the investment thesis of every Bitcoiner. Staying humble is the art of accepting that we do not know what the price of bitcoin will be in the short term. A "crash" is one China ban or unscrupulous exchange rug-pull away.  Those who were rug-pulled think bitcoin is a scam, but the people who understand how the protocol works and take self-custody of their wealth will have an opportunity to stack more sats.  Be the latter group, not the former.

In other words, sats flow from those who do not understand bitcoin to those whom understand bitcoin. The bitcoiners who take self custody of their bitcoin are un-ruggable because they hold their own keys. The SBF's of the world cannot gamble away our sats because they do not own our sats.

A common trope among pre-coiners is, "don't invest in things you don't understand."  This is good advice, but bitcoin is not an investment. It is money built on a decentralized computer network. It is created by laws of mathematics not government.

üì∏ study bitcoin.

**The purpose of this guide is to teach you how to stack sats without going through a financial institution**".  History is filled with examples of breaches of trust, monetary debasement and currency death, the result is double-spending.

This is a counter-culture created by  bitcoiners who run nodes, mine bitcoin, write code or create bitcoin art like paintings, books, and music. Each bitcoin wallet has an identity, like a fingerprint that cannot be changed. It is binary in a non-binary world, freedom in an unfree world. "Stay Humble, stack sats," is a great tagline. The alliteration is phenomenal, but the way I see it, the goal is to **earn sats, spend sats, and save sats**.

Take your time. It won't happen over night. There is much to learn. Most people have heard the advice, "don't invest in things you don't understand." This is great advice. If you do not understand bitcoin, you will almost certainly lose money. Some scammer will call you and give a scary story or tell you you they will give you more bitcoin if you deposit some with them first. Some of these are akin to Nigerian prince emails. Other times, famous people on Twitter get hacked and say they will send 2 bitcoin for every one bitcoin you send them.  This one time, a company bought ad space on the biggest bitcoin podcast and told everyone they would pay a 7% yield on bitcoin deposits. The most recent heist was pulled off by some vegan pervert who claimed to be an autistic genius and effective altruist. The  plain fact is, solving the double spending problem means there is no way to recover your bitcoin if it gets stolen or swindled. You must be vigilant. One whole bitcoin might be worth 10 million dollars in ten years, but if your bitcoin gets stolen or lost, you and your posterity will be unable to spend it.

To protect ourselves, we must:

**NEVER GIVE ANYONE YOUR 12 OR 24 WORD SEED PHRASE**

**REMAIN AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE**

**STAY HUMBLE** 

Staying humble is not as easy as it sounds, but it is necessary. If you get too over-confident, you might make mistakes. Mistakes can be disastrous. We have all heard stories of people combing through landfills hoping to find laptops worth hundreds of millions of dollars. You don't want to be that guy. The goal of this guide is to teach you how to use bitcoin as it was meant to be used--as [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) electronic cash.

## What Is Bitcoin?

Note: **The US now has bitcoin derivatives called ETF's or Spot Bitcoin ETF's**.  These are financial institutions that accept fiat from customers and buy bitcoin on their behalf. They slice and dice this bitcoin and package it up in a pretty financial institutional wrapper. It's a bitcoin backed security. It's a derivative, but it is not bitcoin. **A Bitcoin ETF does not "...allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**." An ETF is a financial institution. This guide is not about teaching you how to send fiat to trusted third parties who take annual fees and keep your money on Coinbase(aside from Fidelity). Maybe they won't get hacked, but if you want to roll the dice, I say buy a Cold Card.

There is nothing I can do to improve the security of financial institutions. I also can't save you from Sim card swaps or from keys you keep on the cloud from being stolen. That being said, if you hold your own keys, you minimize the need to worry about these things.


## Don't Trust, Verify

**You should never trust a financial institution**. This is the whole point of bitcoin. Therefore, the goal of this guide is to teach you the art of stacking sats without going through a financial institution. This might require using tools you, other bitcoiners, or law enforcement disagree with. If all bitcoin was contained in the traditional finance world, it would be:

- easier to monitor.
- easier to confiscate.
- easier to throw people in cages.
- easier to tax.
- easier to steal.
- easier to recover stolen funds.

KYC laws also make it easier for criminals to see how much bitcoin people have. **Pay your taxes**, but don't trust your government. They cannot help you if someone steals your bitcoin. Unlike the US dollar and it's never ending bailouts, bitcoin has no back doors. Inflation is a [backdoor attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor) and governments of the world don't want it patched.

This guide is written from the perspective of cybersecurity. Unlike Paul Krugman, I have no credentials. I am a self-tauaght autodidact bitcoin nerd. I started to study bitcoin about a decade ago. I am not a lawyer and can offer no legal advice.  This book is advice I would give my kids. 

Bitcoin is math. This guide is written from the perspective of a dad teaching his kids how to use that math to save bitcoin **without going through a financial institution**. There are no guarantees and it is written with no warranty. **If you lose your keys**, no one can help you spend your bitcoin. As Satoshi said, it becomes a donation to everyone on the network. This should go without saying, but **Do not lose your keys**

**NEVER TYPE YOUR KEYS INTO A COMPUTER CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET**

**NEVER GIVE YOUR KEYS TO SOMEONE ASKING FOR THEM.**

**NEVER SEND BITCOIN TO SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS HE WILL GIVE YOU MORE BITCOIN IN RETURN**

Here's tge thing about the double spending problem: **There are no chargebacks.** This is a feature, not a bug, but it means mistakes are not reversable.

## Financial Institutions Are The Double Spending Problem

![bailout](https://i.nostr.build/resp/360p/YgRZP.jpg)

The financial institutions are part of the double spending problem. Bitcoin is not an investment. ‚úèÔ∏è. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic system unleashed upon the world at a time when financial institutions were failing. Subprime mortgages were packaged into derivitives. These mortgage derivitives enjoyed an A+ rating from the most prestigious financial rating agencies. They were given the stamp of approval by the people put into power to protect the average investor. **These ratings were lies**. [The Great Financial Crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp)  insued. Many of my working class friends lost their homes. I lost my job along with millions of other people.

The bitcoin white paper was released on October 31st, 2008. The software went live on January 3rd, 2009. The day the genesis block was born using an obscure branch of mathematics known as cryptography, a form of secret writing that has existed for thousands of years.  Satoshi left a secret message in the scriptsig(hex) of this block.
